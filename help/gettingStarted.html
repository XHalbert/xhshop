<h1 style="color:#f00">FIX ME!</h1>
<h2>Opening a shop</h2>
<p>Create a page for your shop and call the xhshop - like any other plug-in -
        with <b>one</b> of the following </p>
<ul>
<li>add <b>#_CMSimple $output .= display_shop();#</b> to your page (the classic way - remove the underscore between "#" and "CMSimple"!) </li>
<li>or this <b>{{{PLUGIN:display_shop();}}}</b> (requires CMSimple_xh 's pluginloader)</li>
<li>or, most comfortable, if you have installed the plugin-plugin <a href="http://www.holgerirmler.de/playground/ccount/click.php?id=1">hi_pd_scripting</a> just fill in the form <b>display_shop();</b>.
</ul>
<p class="additional"> In the former version this step (and latter moving or deleting) of the shop page was done by the script.
        Of course a bit more comfortable, but this way is more CMSimple-ish and, more important, you can now add
        header and footer parts to your shop page(s) without hacking the code. </p>
<p class="additional"> The call "display_shop()" did not change: So if you have been running xhshop before, you do not have to do
        anything. </p>
<p>Switching to preview mode will call the xhshop-shop's admin interface. In the top right corner
        of it there is a link to call the backend. </p>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p> Hopefully the screens are self-explanatory. </p>
<h2>Adding the cart preview</h2>
<p> You don't <i>have to</i> care about this. By default the cart preview is displayed on every single page
        and gets inserted right above the heading. Most probably you will find a better place for it. Just add
<p>
<pre>
       &lt;?php echo $xhsCartPreview; ?&gt;
    </pre>
<p></p>
to an appropriate place in your template.
<p> It's not necessary, but after that you might want to remove or outcomment the lines in
    plugins/xhshop/index.php </p>
<p>
<pre>
if(!strpos(file_get_contents($pth['file']['template']), '$xhsCartPreview')){
  $c[$s] = $xhsController->cartPreview() . $c[$s];
        } </pre>
to spare an unneeded call.
<p></p>
<p> If you don't want to have an always visible cart preview just drop those
    three lines from the xhshop/index.php and link to the cart with a form like this
<pre>
&lt;form action="?&lt;?php echo XHS_URL; ?&gt" method="post"&gt;
    &lt;input value="go to cart" type="submit"&gt;
    &lt;input name="xhsCheckout" value="cart" type="hidden"&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</pre>
<p></p>
<h2>Adding product pages</h2>
<p> The products got two new fields you can edit in the product editor: you can set an image
    and add a more detailed description. </p>
<p> If you add the description the xhshop will generate an internal "product page" and link to it
    from the cart and the product list. </p>
<p> If you already have created cms-pages for the products or want to present them in a more individualistic
    manner: just leave the description empty and xhshop will do as before: link to the first page you have selected in the form
    "product pages". </p>
<h2>Adding a better shop navigation</h2>
<p> In the default templates you will find a selectbox that offers to select the product categories.
    (If you have categorized your products.) That's definitely ugly - so find a nice place in your template
    for
<pre>
&lt;?php echo $xhsController->shopToc(); ?&gt;
</pre>
or, if you just want to show it on the "shop"-page:
<pre>
&lt;?php
      if($su == XHS_URL){
         echo $xhsController->shopToc();
      }
?&gt;
</pre>
&hellip; and remove the selectbox from the shop's catalog-template. (See <span style="background-color:lime">Overwriting the frontend templates</span> below.
<p class="additional"> This shopToc is a simple &lt;ul&gt;-list containing the categories. Pimp it! (The css is up to you &hellip;) </p>
<p></p>
<h2>Relocate the product search input</h2>
<p>The same for the product search input: Remove it from the catalog template and find a better place in your
    CMSimple-template for a form like this:
<pre>
&lt;form action="?&lt;?php echo XHS_URL; ?&gt;" method="post"&gt;
    &lt;input name="xhsProductSearch" value="" type="text" /&gt;
    &lt;input type="submit" value="Produktsuche" /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</pre>
<p></p
>
<h2>Overwriting the frontend templates</h2>
<p> The shop's html output is generated via the templates in the xhshop's subfolder "templates". </p>
<p> If you are scared to touch them - and you really should be careful - just copy the *.tpl-files
    you want to change for the frontend-view into the folder
<pre>
        xhshop/theme/frontend/
</pre>
and play around: xhshop will have a look in there, before it opens the default template.
<p></p>
<p class="additional"> To get an idea what happens: Just rename the xhshop/theme/frontend/test_catalog.tpl to catalog.tpl
    or add some css to the theme/frontend/shopToc.tpl. </p>
<p class="additional"> Won't work with the backend for now. </p>
<h2>Where is the css?</h2>
<p> You will find the <span style="background-color:lime">stylesheet.css in xhshop/css</span>. (It needs some clean-up,
    but hey, this is beta!) </p>
<h2>Further Help</h2>
<p> &hellip; at <a href="http://www.cmsimpleforum.com">CMSimple-Forum</a> </p>
<p> A documentation is to be published either on <a href="http://www.zeichenkombinat.de">zeichenkombinat.de</a> or the <a href="http://www.xhshop.de">xhshop-demo site</a>, but this will take a while and start with German. So please be patient &hellip; </p>
<p> <b>&hellip;and have fun!</b> </p>
